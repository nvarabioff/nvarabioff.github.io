    "text": "&gt; Chess   \n\nI started playing chess online during the first year of my Bachelor’s degree at the University of Waterloo. I found it fascinating that such a simple game could have so many possibilities, and it was the perfect mix of problem solving, quick thinking, and competitiveness that I love. I’ve been playing online since then, as well as part of the University of Waterloo’s chess team that competed in the Collegiate Chess League 2022, finishing top 8 in division 2. I have also made this dashboard to visualize my games and rating on Lichess from 2018-2023.\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Activities   \n\n\n\nI enjoy staying active through a variety of outdoor activities, including running, cycling, and hiking. I’m also active on Strava, where I track my progress and connect with other athletes!\nI’m involved in the community as the treasurer of the UBC AMS Triathlon Club, and I also volunteer at local events, such as the BMO Vancouver marathon when I’ve been unable to participate."

Our project explored how data can optimize strategy for attacking set pieces - specifically free kicks and corners - to deliver actionable insights and inform decision-making in game situations.\nWe delivered statistical models to identify key success factors, a scalable machine learning pipeline accessible behind API endpoints, a comprehensive technical report outlining our methods and findings, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard designed for football analysts to explore data and generate predictions."
