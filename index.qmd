Hello! I'm Nicholas, a Master’s student in Data Science with a strong background in data engineering, machine learning, statistics, and data visualization.

I'm actively exploring opportunities in data science and machine learning in sports to leverage AI for performance optimization and strategic insights.

Feel free to connect with me! I'm excited to explore interesting applications of data science and I'd love to hear from you.

# Interests

## Chess

I'm also a competitive online chess player! I was part of the University of Waterloo's chess team and competed in the Collegiate Chess League 2022, finishing top 8 in division 2.

I made [this dashboard](https://nvarabioff.shinyapps.io/chess-match-history/) with Shiny (R) to visualize my games and rating on Lichess from 2018-2023.

## Activities

I enjoy staying active through a variety of outdoor activities, including running, cycling, and hiking. I’m also active on Strava, where I track my progress and connect with other athletes!

I’m involved in the community as the treasurer of the UBC AMS triathlon club. I also volunteer at local events, such as the BMO Vancouver marathon when I've been unable to participate.
