Hello! I'm Nicholas - a data engineer with a Master's of Data Science and a strong background in machine learning, statistics, and data visualization. My technical experience includes designing cloud-based data architectures, building efficient ETL workflows, working with relational databases and SQL, and developing machine learning models. Outside of work, I’m an active member of the sports community as a runner, triathlete, and hockey fan.

I'm actively exploring opportunities in data engineering and machine learning. Feel free to reach out — I’d love to connect with others working in this space!
